# KompleteDarkness

Use this program to turn off the Light Guide on your Komplete Kontrol device.

**NOTE: this does more than turn off the Light Guide. It also disables the functionality of the Browser/MIDI/Instance buttons. [link](https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/turn-off-light-guide-on-kontrol-mk2-49.325777/page-4)**

This is a side project to my other project, which already had this functionality built-in.
By creating a seperate project for it, everyone who may find it useful is able to use it.
